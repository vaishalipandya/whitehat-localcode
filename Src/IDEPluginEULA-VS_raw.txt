1. Limited License.  Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, WhiteHat grants to End User a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive limited license to use the WhiteHat Sentinel IDE Plugin for Visual Studio software (“Visual Studio Extension”) (i) in object code form for End User’s own internal use of the Visual Studio Extension, (ii) solely in connection with, and during an active subscription to, the WhiteHat services (“Subscription Services”) and (iii) only in accordance with the technical specification documentation generally made available with the Visual Studio Extension and this Agreement (“Documentation”).
2.  Open-Source Software.  The Visual Studio Extension includes software modules licensed from third parties under the terms and conditions of certain free and open-source software licenses (“FOSS Licenses”).  To the extent such FOSS Licenses expressly supersede the terms of this License Agreement, the FOSS Licenses govern your use of the software modules licensed to WhiteHat under those FOSS Licenses.  
3.  Restrictions and Unauthorized Use.

End User acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited license right to the Visual Studio Extension and that irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale” or like terms hereunder no ownership rights are being conveyed to End User under this Agreement or otherwise.  
5.  Support.  Updates or support services for the Visual Studio Extension will be provided as a part of the support services procured by End User for the Subscription Services.

IN NO EVENT SHALL WHITEHAT OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH AN END USER’S USE OF THE Visual Studio Extension.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING HEREIN TO THE CONTRARY, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF WHITEHAT TO END USER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES OR LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, INFRINGEMENT OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT IN ANY EVENT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY END USER WITH RESPECT TO THE Visual Studio Extension.  WHITEHAT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OF DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, SYSTEM DOWNTIME, GOODWILL, PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS LOSS, REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF WHITEHAT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION ARE ESSENTIAL AND THAT WHITEHAT WOULD NOT PERMIT END USER TO USE THE Visual Studio Extension ABSENT THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION.  THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  
9.  Export Compliance.  End User acknowledges that the Visual Studio Extension is subject to export restrictions by the United States government and import restrictions by certain foreign governments.   End User shall not and shall not allow any third-party to remove or export from the United States or allow the export or re-export of any part of the Visual Studio Extension or any direct product thereof:  (i) into (or to a national or resident of) any embargoed or terrorist-supporting country; (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Commerce Department’s Table of Denial Orders or U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals; (iii) to any country to which such export or re-export is restricted or prohibited, or as to which the United States government or any agency thereof requires an export license or other governmental approval at the time of export or re-export without first obtaining such license or approval; or (iv) otherwise in violation of any export or import restrictions, laws or regulations of any United States or foreign agency or authority.  End User agrees to the foregoing and warrants that it is not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list.  The Visual Studio Extension is further restricted from being used for the design or development of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile technology, or for terrorist activity, without the prior permission of the United States government.

12.  Miscellaneous.  Neither this Agreement nor the licenses granted hereunder are assignable or transferable by Licensee (and any attempt to do so shall be void).

Subject to the foregoing, the provisions hereof are for the benefit of the parties only and not for any other person or entity.  Any notice, report, approval, authorization, agreement or consent required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing; notices shall be sent to the address the applicable party has or may provide by written notice or, if there is no such address, the most recent address the party giving notice can locate using reasonable efforts. No failure or delay in exercising any right hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any partial exercise of any right or power hereunder preclude further exercise. If any provision shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this arrangement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties with respect to the license granted herein and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to such license and any waivers or amendments shall be effective only if executed in writing by WhiteHat; however, any pre-printed or standard terms of any purchase order, confirmation, or similar form, unless signed by WhiteHat after the effectiveness hereof, shall have no force or effect.  The substantially prevailing party in any action to enforce this agreement will be entitled to recover its attorney’s fees and costs in connection with such action.
